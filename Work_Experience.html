		<h2>English Teacher</h2><h4>March 2022 - Present</h4><h3>King's Kids International Academy<br>Seoul, South Korea</h3>
		<p>
			After obtaining my TEFL certification from taking a 120-hour course, I decided to challenge myself and fly across the world to Seoul, South Korea. I landed a job at an international English academy where I have worked for 3 years. I have taught ages 7-10 with varying abilities in English. My classes were more advanced, as my homeroom class were in their third year of learning English and were already writing full-page essays!<br><br>
			I have loved teaching, and throughout my time all three of my classes have graduated and gotten into very challenging academies in Gangnam, where competition is very high. Each year, I have adapted the syllabus slightly to fit in with the children’s needs, so not to leave them behind while maintaining a challenge for some of the higher achievers. This has boded well as all my students have shown dramatic improvement while in my classes.<br><br>
			Some of my responsibilities included:
			<br>•	Report writing
			<br>•	Parent-teacher conferences
			<br>•	Presenting at graduation ceremonies
			<br>•	Conducting level tests and entry exams for prospective students
			<br>•	Lesson planning
			<br>•	Adapting the syllabus where needed
			<br>•	Designing and grading tests and assessments

			<br><br>Working for so long abroad in a foreign country has been challenging navigating the cultural and societal differences between the UK and Korea. However, it has been an incredible experience, learning invaluable skills that I shall take with me wherever I go.

		<h2>Sales Assistant - Part Time</h2><h4>August 2021 - January 2022</h4><h3>LEGO, Liverpool</h3><h4>Working Hours: 10 per week</h4>

		<p>
			While also working for Superdry part time and before I would depart for South Korea, I also worked for the LEGO store in Liverpool. This was a great job as it combined a childhood passion of mine with the experience I had as a sales assistant. During the day to day, not only would I promote sets and themes, but I would also engage in organised LEGO play sessions with the children. This was very rewarding and great to see such enjoyment and joy from all the customers who came into the store.<br><br>

		<h2>Special Needs Camp Counsellor</h2><h4>June 2019 - August 2019</h4><h3>Pine Tree Camp, Maine, USA</h3><h4>Working Hours: 96 per week</h4>

		<p>
			Over the summer of 2019, I flew out to Maine in the US to become a camp counsellor. Initially, I was enrolled in leadership training for a week where we learned skills such as evaluation and communication skills as well as the necessary leadership methods we needed to run our own cabins. Each cabin had six international counsellors and up to 16 campers.<br><br>
			I ran a variety of activities, both water-based and land-based. The camp facilitated child and adult campers with a whole spectrum of special needs, both mental and physical. I enjoyed every moment of camp, as we were providing a service that made usual sports and activities accessible for those with special needs. The enjoyment and excitement on their faces was priceless! It was a deeply rewarding job, and I will never forget my experiences working in Maine.<br><br>
			My responsibilities included:
			<br>•	Working with vulnerable children and adults with special needs as a camp counsellor 
			<br>•	Personal care 
			<br>•	Providing a safe and fun environment for both children and adults
