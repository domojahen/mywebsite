		<h2>
			What I'm working on right now
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have always had a fascination for everything puzzling and cryptic. I loved the GCHQ problem books and always had several wooden puzzles on my desk growing up. I would reverse engineer these out of the box and refuse to look at the "cheat sheet" no matter how challenging of a task I faced. <br><br>
			Having both GCSE and A Level Computer Science, I decided to invest my time in learning more about the world of cybersecurity. To do so, I have been taking Mike Meyers' course at Total Seminar alongside reading his CompTIA certification books. Additionally, I am really enjoying Nathan House's courses on StationX.<br><br>
			So far, I have managed to achieve CompTIA A+.<br><br>
			Currently, I am completing CompTIA Network+ and Security+ to gain some foundational knowledge to branch into an analyst role. I am taking online classes with Mike Meyers and Nathan House, alongside my fulltime commitments as an English teacher. Although challenging, I am finding the constant learning cycle to be deeply satisfying and interesting. I am learning a lot, and I'm looking forward to delving deeper!
