		<h2>
			Introduction to this website:
		</h2>
		<p>
			This website was created using pure HTML and not using third party software. It may not look the prettiest, but I can say I truly made this myself! I like to view this as my online CV / resume, showcasing some of my computing-loving side, telling my story, laying out what I'm working on right now and my future ambitions. I would love for you to check it out!<br><br><br>
