		<h2>
			A bit of background about my experience
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Psychology</strong> from the <strong>University of Liverpool</strong>, graduating in 2021. During my studies and after graduation, I have gathered quite a good range of varied experience in different sectors and cultures, including while <strong>working abroad</strong>.<br><br>

			During my degree, <strong>I worked in Maine, United States on a summer camp for special needs children and adults</strong>. This gave me a fantastic opportunity to gain experience not only working abroad, but also engage in leadership training and activity co-ordinating. My team and I worked hard to ensure campers with a variety of special needs could partake in both water and land-based sports and recreational events.<br><br>

			As of right now, I am an <strong>English teacher in Seoul, South Korea</strong>. I have been teaching children aged 7-10 <strong>for three years</strong> now, being in charge of my own class for each one of these years. Working in a culture that is so different from your own hasn't been without challenge, however working in South Korea has given me invaluable skills and knowledge that I want to apply and share in my future career!<br><br><br>
